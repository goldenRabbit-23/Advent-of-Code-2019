| Day | Title | Summary |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 01  | The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation | Compute total fuel from module masses, and include fuel-for-fuel until nonpositive. |
| 02  | 1202 Program Alarm | Run an Intcode program by applying the opcode and parameter rules, then find the noun and verb that make the program produce the desired output (at position 0). |
