## 📅 Daily Overview

| Day | Title | Summary |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 01  | The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation | Compute total fuel from module masses, and include fuel-for-fuel until nonpositive. |
| 02  | 1202 Program Alarm | Run an Intcode program by applying the opcode and parameter rules, then find the noun and verb that make the program produce the desired output (at position 0). |
| 03  | Crossed Wires | Find the wires’ intersections (excluding origin), then pick the one with minimum Manhattan distance and the one with fewest combined steps. |
| 04  | Secure Container | Count the valid passwords that meet the requirements within the given range. |
| 05  | Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids | Extend the Intcode computer with additional instructions and parameter modes, then run the program to output the final diagnostic code. |
| 06  | Universal Orbit Map | Sum all nodes’ distances to `COM`, then find the shortest path between the objects that `YOU` and `SAN` orbit. |
| 07  | Amplification Circuit | Run an Amplifier Controller Software feedback-loop system to find the highest signal that can be sent to the thrusters with specific phase settings. |
| 08  | Space Image Format | Decode the image encoded in Space Image Format to reveal the hidden message. |
| 09  | Sensor Boost | Run the given BOOST program to obtain the BOOST keycode and the coordinates of the distress signal. |
| 10  | Monitoring Station | Determine the optimal location for a monitoring station that can detect the maximum number of asteroids, then identify the 200th asteroid vaporized by a clockwise-rotating laser. |
| 11  | Space Police | Run the robot's Intcode program to paint panels black or white, then read the registration identifier it leaves when the program halts. |
| 12  | The N-Body Problem | Simulate the motion of four moons for 1000 steps to compute the total energy, then determine how many steps it takes for the system to return to a previous state. |
| 13  | Care Package | Run the Intcode-based arcade game, count initial block tiles, then play in free mode to break all blocks and report the final score. |
| 14  | Space Stoichiometry | Compute the minimum amount of `ORE` needed to produce exactly 1 `FUEL`, then determine the maximum amount of `FUEL` you can produce from 1 trillion `ORE`. |
| 15  | Oxygen System | Run the Intcode-powered repair droid to locate the oxygen system, fully map the area, and determine how many minutes it takes for oxygen to fill the entire region. |
| 16  | Flawed Frequency Transmission | Compute the first eight digits of the signal after 100 FFT phases, then compute the eight-digit message at the offset after 100 phases when the input is repeated 10000 times. |
| 17  | Set and Forget | Run the Intcode ASCII program to read the scaffold map, compute the alignment-parameter sum, then compress the robot's movement path into three functions and feed them to the robot to report how much dust it collects. |
| 18  | Many-Worlds Interpretation | Compute the minimum number of steps required to collect every key in the tunnels—once with a single robot and again with four robots starting from separate vaults. |
| 19  | Tractor Beam | Run the Intcode drone system to count how many points in the 50×50 area are affected by the tractor beam, then locate the closest position where a 100×100 square fits entirely within the beam. |
| 20  | Donut Maze | Find the shortest route from `AA` to `ZZ` through portal teleports, then solve the recursive version where inner portals descend a level and outer portals ascend, reaching `ZZ` only at the outermost layer. |
| 21  |       |         |
| 22  |       |         |
| 23  |       |         |
| 24  |       |         |
| 25  |       |         |
